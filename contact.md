### How can we help?

1. **Government & funding briefings** – Support for NRC IRAP, IDEaS, and agency pilots (roadmap decks, demo artifacts, security responses).  
2. **Operator demos** – Ask for the **ingest → fusion → CoT replay** session; we’ll run `make e2e`, stream Cursor-on-Target frames into TAK, and walk through telemetry.  
3. **Investor diligence** – Schedule a deeper dive into TAM, metrics, and technology with repo access for your technical partners.
