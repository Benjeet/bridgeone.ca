## Secure data fusion & decision systems

**Bridge One Technologies** builds secure, ontology-driven software that connects and interprets data across sensors, networks, and organizations.  
Our mission is to give Canadian and allied partners the ability to see, simulate, and act with clarity in complex operational environments.

We are developing **Canada’s sovereign data fusion and decision platform** — engineered for defense, infrastructure, and emergency response systems.

Supported through **Canada’s innovation ecosystem**, including NRC IRAP and the IDEaS program, Bridge One Technologies collaborates with government and industry to advance secure, AI-assisted command and control.
