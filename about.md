**Bridge One Technologies** builds secure, ontology-driven software that connects and interprets data across sensors, networks, and organizations for defense, infrastructure, and emergency operations.

### Built for agencies, operators, and investors

- **Policy / funding stakeholders:** We understand IRAP, IDEaS, and provincial procurement rhythms. Every sprint concludes with a working demo, compliance artefacts, and clear next-step asks.  
- **Operational users:** Our Go services, PostGIS persistence, and CoT gateway run in the same secure environments as TAK. Replay scripts let crews rehearse scenarios without bespoke integration.  
- **Capital partners:** Transparent roadmap, MIT-licensed core, and metrics-rich testing make due diligence fast and predictable.

### How we work

1. **Test-driven increments.** Write the test, ship the code, prove it with a command (`make e2e`).  
2. **Telemetry everywhere.** `/healthz`, `/metrics`, and structured logs on day one—no surprises in production.  
3. **Sovereign-first delivery.** Canadian-controlled team, auditable supply chain, ready for on-prem or classified deployments.

### Leadership & advisors

- **Benjeet Bains – Founder & CEO.** Former CAF reservist and technologist guiding modernization programs across government and critical infrastructure.  
- **Advisory circle.** Mission veterans from NORAD, public safety, and venture capital who help steer commercialization, compliance, and scaling.  
- **Delivery partners.** Trusted SMEs for TAK, PostGIS, and security accreditation who embed with us as needed.

### 2025 milestones already delivered

- Telemetry & PostGIS stack with reproducible migrations.  
- HTTP ingest → fusion tracker → `/v1/tracks` API.  
- CoT mapper + TAK gateway and replay scripts for live demos.

### What’s next

1. **Mission packaging & replay analytics** with richer dashboards for operators.  
2. **Access control & accreditation packs** aligned to GC and allied standards.  
3. **Scalable federation** (multi-site TAK, knowledge graph) when missions demand it.
